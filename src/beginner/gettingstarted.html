  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <h3> Goals </h3>

  <p> Setting clear, attainable goals is a crucial step in your fitness journey, especially when starting out in the
    gym. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the array of machines, exercises, and potential workout routines. By
    identifying specific, achievable objectives, you can focus your efforts and measure your progress, which in
    turn, helps maintain motivation and reduces feelings of being overwhelmed. Goals give you direction and purpose
    each time you step into the gym, ensuring your workout routine is structured and aligned with what you want to
    achieve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start small to build confidence and momentum. For example, if your ultimate goal is to run a 5K, begin by aiming
    to run for a continuous 5 minutes, gradually increasing your time each week. This approach keeps the process
    manageable and less intimidating. Remember, consistency over perfection is key. Regularly showing up and
    sticking to your goals, even on days when progress seems slow, lays the foundation for long-term success.
  </p>

  <h3> Sets and Reps</h3>

  <p> In the context of physical exercise, "reps" and "sets" are fundamental concepts used to structure and describe
    workout routines. "Reps," short for repetitions, refer to the number of times you perform a specific exercise
    without
    stopping. For example, doing ten push-ups in a row counts as ten reps. On the other hand, "sets" are groups of
    repetitions performed sequentially, separated by rest periods. If you complete three rounds of ten push-ups, taking
    a
    break between each round, you have done three sets of ten reps each. This method of organizing workouts helps in
    managing the intensity, volume, and focus of your training sessions, allowing for targeted muscle engagement,
    endurance building, and strength development. By adjusting the number of reps and sets, individuals can tailor their
    workout programs to meet specific fitness goals, whether they're aiming for muscle gain, weight loss, or overall
    health improvement.
  </p>

  <h3> Core </h3>

  <h4> How to engage your core </h4>

  <div class="list-all-ordered">
    <ol>
      <li>Start with Posture: Stand or sit up tall with your feet hip-width apart. Imagine a string pulling the top of
        your head towards the ceiling, lengthening your spine.
      </li>
      <li> Breathe Deeply: Focus on breathing deeply into your diaphragm (the area just below your ribcage). Inhale
        deeply
        through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to rise.
      </li>
      <li> Tighten the Muscles: As you exhale, gently tighten the muscles around your stomach and hips, as if you're
        bracing for an impact. Imagine you’re trying to zip up a tight pair of jeans or drawing your belly button
        towards
        your spine.
      </li>
      <li>Maintain Breathing: Keep the muscles engaged while maintaining your ability to breathe. It's crucial not to
        hold
        your breath—continue breathing deeply and steadily.
      </li>
      <li> Practice Holding: Start by holding this engaged position for 10-15 seconds, gradually increasing the duration
        as your endurance improves.
      </li>
    </ol>
