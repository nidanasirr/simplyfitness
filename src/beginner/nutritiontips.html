    <h1> Nutrition Tips </h1>

    <p> Here I will give you some information on nutrition that you might need to know according to your goals.</p>

    <h3> Gaining Muscle </h3>

    <div class="list-all">
        <ul>
            <li> Prioritize Protein: Protein is the building block of muscle. To support muscle growth, aim for a
                protein
                intake of about 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Good sources include lean meats,
                fish,
                dairy products, legumes, and plant-based proteins like tofu and tempeh.
            </li>
            <li> Don't Neglect Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are crucial for replenishing energy stores that are depleted
                during workouts. They also play a role in insulin release, which helps shuttle nutrients into your
                muscles.
                Focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for sustained energy.
            </li>
            <li> Include Healthy Fats: Fats are essential for hormone production, including hormones like testosterone
                that
                are involved in muscle growth. Incorporate sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and
                olive
                oil into your diet.
            </li>
            <li> Stay Hydrated: Adequate hydration is vital for optimal performance in the gym and recovery afterward.
                Water
                is essential for transporting nutrients to your muscles and can help prevent injuries by maintaining
                muscle
                elasticity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Supplements Can Help: While whole foods should be your primary source of nutrients, supplements such as
                whey
                protein, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can support muscle growth when used in
                conjunction
                with a balanced diet.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Losing Fat </h3>

    <div class="list-all">
        <ul>
            <li> Create a Caloric Deficit: The foundational principle of fat loss is to consume fewer calories than you
                burn. This can be achieved by slightly reducing your daily caloric intake, increasing physical activity,
                or
                a combination of both. However, the deficit shouldn't be so large that it leads to rapid weight loss,
                which
                can negatively impact your metabolism and muscle mass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase Protein Intake: A higher protein diet can help preserve muscle mass while you're losing fat,
                which
                is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism. Protein is also more satiating, helping you feel fuller
                for
                longer, which can reduce overall calorie intake. Aim for lean sources like chicken, turkey, fish, beans,
                and
                legumes.
            </li>
            <li> Manage Carbohydrate Intake: While carbohydrates are essential for energy, focusing on the quality and
                timing of carbohydrate intake can support fat loss. Opt for complex carbohydrates like whole grains,
                vegetables, and fruits, and consider consuming them around workouts when your body can use them more
                efficiently.
            </li>
            <li> Plan Your Meals: Planning meals and snacks ahead of time can help you make healthier choices, avoid
                impulsive eating, and ensure you're meeting your nutritional needs without overeating.
            </li>
        </ul>
